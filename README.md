# docker-technical-assignment

This was a technical assignment I completed for a Senior Data Engineer interview process, which allowed me to progress to the next round. In this toy project, I use Docker to set up and load data into a Postgres database, in which a cron job updates a table every minute via a Python script. 

The original instructions for the assignment can be found in `README_instructions.md`, including my answers to some follow-up questions, and the Docker container can be run using `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`.
